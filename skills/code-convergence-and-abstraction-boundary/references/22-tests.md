# Duplicate and Meaningless Tests

## Applicability

Use this reference when adding or changing test cases, test helpers, fixtures, mocks, coverage-driven tests, regression tests, or boundary tests.

## Best Practices

Cover behavior through:

1. Normal paths.
2. Boundary values.
3. Empty values.
4. Exceptional values.
5. Permission differences.
6. State transitions.
7. Error handling.
8. Data conversion.
9. Business rules.
10. Regression scenarios.

Organize tests around observable behavior. Keep test data, helpers, and fixtures simple enough that they do not obscure the unit under test.

## Do Not

1. Do not duplicate tests with equivalent inputs, outputs, and assertions.
2. Do not keep differently named test cases with identical assertions.
3. Do not test a wrapper that contains no logic.
4. Do not test only mocked results instead of real behavior.
5. Do not cover the same simple path repeatedly across multiple test files.
6. Do not write behaviorless tests only to increase coverage.
7. Do not repeat happy-path tests while missing boundary, error, empty, or invalid-value cases.
8. Do not repeatedly construct the same test data.
9. Do not duplicate test helpers or fixtures.
10. Do not let test helpers become more complex than the logic under test.
11. Do not test implementation details instead of behavioral outcomes.
12. Do not add meaningless tests only because a thin wrapper exists.

## Additional Constraints

1. Shared test helpers must encode setup mechanics, not hide the behavior being asserted.
2. Mocks, fixtures, and builders that represent the same domain entity must share defaults from one test data boundary.
3. Do not duplicate production business rules inside mocks or fixtures; import the trusted production rule when the test needs the same behavior.
4. When converging production behavior, update tests to assert the shared rule once and keep scenario-specific assertions explicit.
